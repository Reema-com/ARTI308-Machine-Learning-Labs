This lab focuses on identifying the type of machine learning problem and selecting a suitable open dataset.  
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle was used, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

This is a **supervised classification problem**, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  
The target variable is **Survived**, which indicates if a passenger lived (1) or did not live (0).

The dataset was loaded and inspected using Python and Pandas to examine its shape, columns, and data types.  
A methodology diagram was designed to represent the overall machine learning workflow.
